This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> function only works with integer array and it was implemented in C++. And in <a>order to use this program you will :-

function name = binary search(array, number that needed to find);
int integer_array=[912,837,384,471,586,474,49,4719,3857,381648];
int findthenumber= binarysearch(integer_array, 49);

result positive; index position=5;
